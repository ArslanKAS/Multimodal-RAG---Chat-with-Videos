00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.879
As I look back on the the mission that we've had here

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.559
on the International Space Station,
I'm proud to have been a part of much of

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.679
the science activities that happened over the last

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.420
two months.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.780
The view is always amazing

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.520
I didn't think I would do another

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.720
spacewalk and to now have the chance to have done

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.840
four more was just icing on the cake for a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.900
a wonderful mission.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.900
Does the 10th one feel like the first one?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.160
No, a little more comfortable on the tenth one.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.300
It's hard to put into words

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.480
just what it was like to be a part of
this expedition, expedition 63. It'll be

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.399
kind of a memory that will last a

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.260
lifetime for me. It's been a true honor.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.800
Dragon SpaceX

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.160
undock sequence commanded. Thrusters
looking good.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.440
The hardest part was getting us launched,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.080
but the most important part is bringing us home.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.180
Rise and shine Daddy. We love you.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.160
Hurry home so we can go get my dog.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.920
Splashdown!

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.200
Welcome back to planet Earth and thanks for flying SpaceX.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.940
It's truly our honor and privilege.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.800
Space Dads are back on Earth

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.140
after a 19-hour return journey from space.
